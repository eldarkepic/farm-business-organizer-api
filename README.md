# Requirements

Poultry farming is a job that requires constant monitoring in order to maintain proper and quality health of both poultry and products. As these are food products intended for human consumption, legal regulations are very strict and must be respected. Continuous supervision can detect irregularities and give the opportunity to prevent serious problems.

Company also needs to maintain the business which involves managing the storage of goods and market situation. It is necessary to keep track of the financial situation and history with the business partners.

Farm has several different warehouses where all inward and outward traffic must be noted. Food storage is supplied with grain from various sources and each one of them has details like name, invoice, amount, producer and date. Farm has its own production line for animal feed which is obtained from raw grain. Another part of storage is intended to eggs and their packaging. Each packet should contain information like category, weight, class and certificate. Whenever product comes into a warehouse or leaves from it, invoice or some other verification must be issued.

Regarding laying hens, daily records are mandatory. They should contain information like daily production, the amount of food spent on hens, number of deaths, given vitamins and inspections. Based on daily activities, other records can be compiled and laying hens productivity coefficient can be calculated.

The company owns a wide range feed production line. It uses raw cereals and other components to make food for almost all domestic animals. For each of these mixtures, there is a recipe with all needed components. Raw cereals and final feed products are already mentioned in a warehouse but tracking their consumption could be automated. All recipes might be added to the system and user can select ones that were made on a certain day and automatically update stock.

Not only will automating this process minimize errors, but it will also reduce delivery time and make the organization more competitive. As a result, it was decided to create an automated system to optimize and simplify the workflow.
